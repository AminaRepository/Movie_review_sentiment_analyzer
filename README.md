This is a project for the Natural language processing course.

This project is going to look at movie reviews on the RottenTomatoes website and use a sentiment analyzer to try and guess the overall
rating of the movie through them. The goal is to gain insight into the numerical rating of the movie through the words and tone of the review.

The code was originally written and developed using Jupyter and is in the .ipynb file.
There is a .py file downloaded from jupyter, for any needs of a python file and easier use.
